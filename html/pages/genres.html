    <title>My Dj Hobby - Genres</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Favorite Genres</h1>
    <p>
        As a Dj, I enjoy playing and mixing different genres of music: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Melodic Techno</h2>
            <p>Melodic techno is a sub-genre of techno that has a (debateable but highly likely) heavy influence of trance music. Melodic techno often focuses more on melodic progressions than your standard techno. 
            It has a slower tempo than trance, normally between 120-125 BPM, 
            and softer percussion that draws from minimal techno</p>

            <h2>Techno</h2>
            <p>Techno is a genre of electronic dance music (EDM) which is generally produced for use in a continuous DJ set, with tempo often varying between 120 and 150 beats per minute (bpm). 
            The central rhythm is typically in common time (4/4) and often characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat.</p>

        <li>
            <h2>Techno House</h2>
            <p>The term tech house developed as a shorthand record store name for a category of electronic dance music that combined musical aspects of techno, 
            such as "rugged basslines" and "steely beats," with the harmonies and grooves of progressive house.</p>
